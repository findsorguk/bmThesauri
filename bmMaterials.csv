'Billon' is particularly associated with the coinage of medieval and early modern Europe, where it formed a recognised third level of currency, alongside gold and fine silver, used for low denominations. It is also known as 'black money' and 'base-silver'. From the 16th century it came to be replaced by copper coinage, but did not disappear completely until the 19th century."

Although technically enamel is glass with a lower melting temperature, the way enamel is applied and worked is quite different from glass, and users tend to search for such objects independently. Mosaic glass is mostly Hellenistic in date and was created by chopping up rods and fusing them together in a mould of some sort."

http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/thesauri/x10880,glazed composition,"The term is used for objects with a body made of finely powdered quartz grains fused together with small amounts of alkali and/or lime through partial heating. The bodies are usually colourless but natural impurities give them a brown or greyish tint. Colourants can also be added to give it an artificial colour. It can be modelled by hand, thrown or moulded, and hardens with firing. This material is used in the context of Islamic ceramics where it is described as stonepaste (or fritware). Glazed composition is related to glass, but glass is formed by completely fusing the ingredients in a liquid melted at high temperature. This material is also popularly called faience in the contexts of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Near East. However, this is a misnomer as these objects have no relationship to the glazed pottery vessels made in Faenza, from which the faience term derives. Other authors use the terms sintered quartz, glazed frit, frit, composition, Egyptian Blue, paste or (in the 19th century) even porcelain, although the last two terms are very inappropriate as they also describe imitation gems and a type of ceramic. Frit is technically a flux."

It has been decided that the 'chemical' name will be the Broad Term. In order to broaden the scope of searches, certain terms are under both 'mineral' and 'stone'. N.B. - Stalagmite and stalagtite are composed of secondary minerals, mainly calcium carbonate, and are closely linked to the formation of limestone. - The term ‘crystal’ refers to a solid material that has its molecules or atoms or ions in a repeating, ordered (geometric) arrangement. Many different minerals and metals are in crystalline state or form. Although in the absence of a more specific identification, the Material could therefore be 'metal' as well as 'mineral', it is assumed that the latter is more likely, and so the term 'mineral' is entered as a Material."
