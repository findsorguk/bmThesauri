This process is exhausting and involves several individuals over the course of several hours. The bubble forms the hollow centre and the tube is cut into lengths of about a metre which are then assigned to other workers who chop the tubes into small individual beads. The beads are usually heat-treated in order to finish the sharp ends: this is done by packing them in ash or sand to minimise them sticking together when they are re-heated and stirring them until the ends become smooth and rounded. They are then cleaned, sorted by size where necessary and in recent times were threaded for sale according to the weight of the bunch.

Trails of a different colour can be easily applied at this stage.
