The hippodrome was a long rectangular area where in Greek times, chariot and horse races were staged, often with little if any architecture but sometimes with banks of earth for the spectators to stand on, and its use continued down into Roman times. Some well-known Roman examples include the Circus of Maxentius (Circus of Caracalla), the Circus Maximus and the Circus Flavinius. See also the terms 'Roman amphitheatre/arena', 'classical theatre/odeon' and 'classical stadium'. N.B. The Stadium of Domitian, also known as the 'Circo Aragonale', and sometimes as the 'Circus of Domitian', was a stadium, not a circus."

http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/thesauri/x116344,classical mythological figure/creature,"In some cases a Narrow Term of 'classical mythological figure' is also the name of an individual, recorded in the Associated Name field. Examples include: sibyl and Cumean Sibyl', 'triton and 'Triton', 'amazon' and 'Amazon', etc. Certain figures in classical mythology, e.g. Herakles (Hercules), are considered as both a classical deity and classical mythological figure and these two Subjects should be entered in such cases."
http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/thesauri/x12641,classical mythology,"The term classical mythology is used for scenes of classical mythology. If the main subject of the image is a classical deity, mythological figure or mythical creature, the Subjects 'classical deity' or 'classical mythological figure/creature' (or its Narrow Terms) are used instead of 'classical mythology', and their individual names, when known, are entered in Associated Name. N.B. Some named mythological figures or creatures (Biographical Authority entries and Associated Name field) have become generic terms (Subject field) as well, e.g. Nereid, Triton, and a nereid or triton, etc. If those named individuals are recorded in Associated Name, the Subject term equivalent has to be entered as well, but not vice-versa."
http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/thesauri/x45777,classical sport,"The term encompasses the athletic contests, exercise and spectacles which took place in the Greek and Roman world. Before such events became part of major games festivals and entertainment, they were often part of funeral rituals, with the contests originally held to decide who should inherit the possessions of the deceased. A variety of events, many of which are not exclusive to the Classical World, were involved. In addition to the five major games festivals held at Olympia, Delphi, Nemea, Corinth and the Isthmus, there were hundreds of minor sports festivals. All tended to have the same core events: running, the pentathlon (running, discus, javelin, long jump, wrestling), combat events (boxing, wrestling, the pankration) and equestrian events (chariot and bare-back racing), with a variety of additions. From the surviving depictions we cannot know whether a particular festival is being represented, but because the core events were common to nearly all the games we can use them as generic representations of these sports. For example, no depictions survive that we can directly associate with the ancient Olympics but athletic and equestrian scenes on vases, the bulk of which were produced in Athens, can nonetheless be used to illustrate the type of events that were staged at the Olympics. By Roman times sports contests, especially gladiatorial combat and chariot racing, were increasingly employed as entertainment. See ‘amphitheatre/arena’, ‘palaistra/gymnasium’, ‘stadium’. If a sport is depicted in the context of classical sport, but the Subject term for it is not included as a Narrow Term here (e.g. athletics), the additional Subject term 'classical sport' is added."
http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/thesauri/x116184,classical stadium,"The term applies to a Greek or Roman long, rectangular structure, sometimes with banks or seats for viewing, purpose-built for athletic contests. .See also the term 'circus/hippodrome'.

http://collection.britishmuseum.org/id/thesauri/x116183,classical theatre/odeon,"In Greek and Roman cultures, a theatre was a building purpose-built for housing dramatic performances and contests, whereas an odeon was a roofed building used for musical performances. Some well-known examples of theatres include those at Ephesus, Epidaurus, Herculaneum, Jerash, Miletus, Rome (Theatre of Marcellus), Pompeii (the 'Great' or 'large' theatre), Syracuse, Taormina. The Odeon at Pompeii is sometimes referred to as the 'small theatre’ or occasionally as the ‘covered theatre'. See also the term 'Roman amphitheatre/arena'."

A great wall was built around the palace, and all negative influences were kept away from the young prince. The prince was happy and successful. He married and had a child. However, one day he decided to leave the palace to see his people. During this visit he encountered old age, sickness and death for the first time. He was profoundly moved, and the compassion within him led him to want to bring an end to the suffering."

The theme can first be identified in 16th-century Italian art, notably in Venice in the paintings of Giorgione and Titian, although the term fête champêtre was not applied at the time. Its development can be traced through to the 18th century when a variant, known as the fête galante, practised principally by French artists (notably Antoine Watteau, Nicolas Lancret and Jean-Baptiste Pater), gained popularity as a genre. Subsequently, from the early 19th century the term fête champêtre was increasingly applied to the earlier Italian works and to the theme as a whole."
